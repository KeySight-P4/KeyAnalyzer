# KeyAnalyser

This program takes JSON files generated from P4 programs as input and generate the packet equvilence class (PEC) representation. And users can get a json file for every P4 program through [p4c-bm](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c-bm.git).

The [tests](tests/) folder contains some testing files (in P4 or JSON) for KeyAnalyzer.
